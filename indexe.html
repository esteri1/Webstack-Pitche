        One of the earliest applications of Haptic Technology was in large aircraft that use servomechanism systems to operate control surface, 
            Haptic Technologies have been explored in virtual arts, such as sound synthesis or graphic design, that makes some loose vision and animation             
            Force-feedback can be used to increase adherence to a safe flight envelope and thus reduce the risk of pilots.</p>

        <p>Haptics is defined as a technology that transmits tactile information using sensations such as vibration, 
            touch, and force feedback. Virtual reality systems and real-world
             haptics to enhance interactions with humans.</p>

            <img src="icon4.png" alt="image" width="250px" height="250px">
            <p>How exactly do haptics work? Before we dive into the workings of this technology, 
                letâ€™s first understand the role of the human skin. This complex organ is full of touch receptors
                 and nerve endings called the somatosensory system. This system notifies the brain of heat,
                  cold, pain, and other sensations that humans feel.</p>

            <h2>Based on feedback</h2>
            <img src="icon5.png" alt="image" width="250px" height="250px">
            <p>This form of haptics originated in the late 1960s, making it one of the oldest and most well-studied types of this technology. 
                It stimulates human skin, muscles, and ligaments, unlike other haptics types that generally
                 affect only the top layers of skin receptors.</p>
